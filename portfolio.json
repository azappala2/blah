      "pageSummary": "This comprehensive capstone project focused on developing a sustainable solution for nutrient recovery from wastewater streams. The project involved designing and optimizing an innovative electrochemical reactor system that transforms waste into valuable fertilizer products.\n\nThe reactor design featured a unique annular configuration with a rotating magnesium electrode, enabling efficient electrochemical precipitation of struvite (MgNH₄PO₄·6H₂O) from anaerobic digester sidestreams. This approach addresses two critical environmental challenges: wastewater treatment and sustainable fertilizer production.\n\nKey technical achievements included comprehensive process modeling using a custom Excel model to optimize reactor conditions, detailed safety analysis through Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), and thorough economic evaluation demonstrating commercial viability. The integrated approach considered energy consumption, yield optimization, and downstream processing requirements.\n\nThe economic analysis projected significant revenue potential of $1.5 million per year, making this technology commercially attractive for wastewater treatment facilities. The project demonstrated how chemical engineering principles can be applied to create circular economy solutions that benefit both the environment and industry.",
